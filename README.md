A simple program for generating Polish first names, last names, and cities and saving them to an .xlsx file.
The program is intended to help generate data for Excel exercises; work is still in progress.

The program works in a very straightforward way.
It reads data from an .xlsx file, then randomly selects from a pool, and finally saves the data to an .xlsx file before closing.
